Displays a sitewide link to the WooCommerce cart which reveals the cart contents on hover.

== Description ==

A big UX mistake on many eCommerce web sites is hiding access to the cart. The next logical step after adding a product to the cart is to buy it. Don't frustrate your customers by making them search for the cart button!

Upon activationg this plugin will display a link to the WooCommerce cart which is visible sitewide and fixed in position so it remains visible wherever the user scrolls. When the user hovers over the tab, the full cart widget is displayed.

There are options (Catalog tab, WooCommerce settings) to display the cart tab on the right or the left, to use a light or dark skin to match your theme and to display the cart widget on hover or not.

1. Upload `woocommerce-cart-tab` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Choose your display settings on the catalog tab of the WooCommerce settings screen
3. Done!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= It doesn't look like the screenshots on my site, what gives? =

This plugin uses CSS3 for things like animation, rounded corners and box shadows. If you're not using a modern browser then it might not look the same as the screenshots.

There is also the possibility that your theme is overwriting styles although that will be unlikely.

= I found and fixed a bug how can I help? =
