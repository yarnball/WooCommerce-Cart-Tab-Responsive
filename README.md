WooCommerce Cart Tab [Project Responsive]


Intro:

This is a great little plugin that. With just a few small changes, it can be even better.

The author has given his permission to work on this so please contribute.

To do: 

* Disable cart tab as a link to cart [Can't simply remove a ref from php. Possibly it relates to ]

* Disable "Hover" ability- make it so we can "click" it and it pops out [can set it to disappear after a time limit or when scroll]

Basic CSS:
* Tweaks using @media CSS function to resize and reposition the cart-tab
